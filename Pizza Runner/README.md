# PIZZA RUNNER (Case Study 2)
Danny, inspired by the global love for pizza, embarked on a venture named Pizza Runner, combining 80s Retro Styling with a pizza delivery concept. To secure seed funding for his Pizza Empire, he innovatively decided to "Uberize" it. Danny recruited runners to deliver pizza and developed a mobile app for customer orders, leveraging his background as a data scientist to prioritize data collection for business growth. Despite creating an entity relationship diagram for the database, Danny seeks assistance in cleaning and analyzing the data. The datasets, residing within the pizza_runner database schema, require refinement for effective decision-making in optimizing Pizza Runner's operations.
