# DANNY'S DINER (Case Study 1)
Danny, an enthusiast of Japanese cuisine, took a bold step in early 2021 by opening Danny's Diner, a cozy restaurant featuring his top three favorites: sushi, curry, and ramen. Despite capturing basic operational data, the restaurant struggles to leverage it effectively. Danny seeks assistance in analyzing customer behavior, spending patterns, and menu preferences to enhance their overall experience. The goal is to make informed decisions, such as expanding the customer loyalty program. Privacy concerns limit the data shared, but Danny provides three crucial datasets (sales, menu, and members) for crafting SQL queries to extract meaningful insights  and facilitate easy data inspection for his team.
